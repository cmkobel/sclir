If you've printed to a display (e.g. a PC screen), there's probably a way to do a reverse linefeed and then print some blanks to overwrite whatever is already on the line.  If you'll be more specific about what you have in mind, I'll see what I can rig up.   \"Curses\" is a UNIX library to let a program be somewhat device independent while doing things on a screen  (e.g. vi).   A more-or-less portable version of it is available for Python.  See 15.11. curses - Terminal handling for character-cell displays - Python 2.7.11 documentation" #"Der var en ko"
